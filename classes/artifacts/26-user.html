						<p>For the twenty-sixth class, we are going to take a look at some of the <b>REPLICA data and benchmarks</b>, to get a sense of what the user-collected data looks like, and how these users interact with the Coq proof assistant.</p>
						
						<p>Luckily, there is <b>no installation required</b> for this! Hopefully that is a nice relief after some of the installation troubles recently (sorry about that).</p>
						
						    <p>You can find the <a href="#hack">exercise</a> we will do together in class below.</p>

						<!--<p>During class, after dividing into groups, open up the VM for the artifact. Then, as a group, run the model on a number of different projects (see the <code>README.md</code> instructions that you downloaded when you installed the VM). Look at the outputs for particular proofs and projects, and discuss the following questions with your group:</p>
						
						<ol>
						<li>What proofs does the model seem to do well on? Do they have anything in common?</li>
						<li>What proofs does the model seem to struggle with? Do they have anything in common?</li>
						<li>Does the model seem to have any common modes of failure (for example, running the same tactic over and over again)?</li>
						<li>What would it mean to reproduce the results from this paper fully, in an ideal world? What resources might it require access to?</li>
						<li>Can you think of any ideas to address any limitations you encounter, like common failure modes or reproducibility limitations?</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>These will be your discussion questions at the end. As usual, they will be the <b>only graded part</b>. A partial answer is fine, so don't worry if you struggle to answer some of these questions. When you're done, please have your group post your answers in <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/71">this thread</a>, listing all group members in your response.</p>
						
						<p>You can do this on your own if you cannot make it to class, or enter a Zoom breakout if you're remote. Let me know if you can't attend, but would like me to find you a partner or make an exception.</p>-->
