open Evd

(* --- State monad --- *)

(*
 * All terms in Coq have to carry around evar_maps (found in the Evd module),
 * which store a bunch of constraints about terms that help with things like
 * unification, type inference, and equality checking. This is annoying to
 * deal with, so I usually define some helper functions to make it easier.
 *
 * These come from https://github.com/uwplse/coq-plugin-lib in stateutils.ml,
 * and the idea to use this design pattern comes from my grad school advisor
 * Dan Grossman.
 *
 * For any type 'a, a 'a state is a tuple of an evar_map and a 'a.
 * So basically, a 'a that carries around an evar_map.
 *)
type 'a state = evar_map * 'a

(*
 * These are monadic return and bind. Basically, they let you kind of pretend
 * you're not in the state monad (that is, pretend you're not carrying around
 * an evar_map with you everywhere). If you've ever used Haskell, it's common
 * to have syntax that makes this kind of thing look even nicer.
 *)
let ret a = fun sigma -> sigma, a
let bind f1 f2 = (fun sigma -> let sigma, a = f1 sigma in f2 a sigma)

(* Like List.fold_left, but threading state *)
let fold_left_state f b l sigma =
  List.fold_left (fun (sigma, b) a -> f b a sigma) (sigma, b) l

(* List List.map, but threading state *)
let map_state f args =
  bind
    (fold_left_state
       (fun bs a sigma ->
         let sigma, b = f a sigma in
         sigma, b :: bs)
       []
       args)
    (fun fargs -> ret (List.rev fargs))

(* Like fold_left_state, but over arrays *)
let fold_left_state_array f b args =
  fold_left_state f b (Array.to_list args)

(* Like map_state, but over arrays *)
let map_state_array f args =
  bind
    (map_state f (Array.to_list args))
    (fun fargs -> ret (Array.of_list fargs))

(* --- Environments and definitions --- *)

(*
 * Environments in the Coq kernel map names to types. Here are a few
 * utility functions for environments.
 *)
               
(*
 * This gets the global environment and the corresponding state:
 *)
let global_env () =
  let env = Global.env () in
  Evd.from_env env, env

(* Push a local binding to an environment *)
let push_local (n, t) env =
  EConstr.push_rel Context.Rel.Declaration.(LocalAssum (n, t)) env

(*
 * One of the coolest things about plugins is that you can use them
 * to define new terms. Here's a simplified (yes it looks terrifying,
 * but it really is simplified) function for defining new terms and storing them
 * in the global environment.
 *
 * This will only work if the term you produce
 * type checks in the end, so don't worry about accidentally proving False.
 * If you want to use the defined function later in your plugin, you
 * have to refresh the global environment by calling global_env () again,
 * but we don't need that in this plugin.
 *)
let define name body sigma =
  let udecl = UState.default_univ_decl in
  let scope = Locality.Global Locality.ImportDefaultBehavior in
  let kind = Decls.(IsDefinition Definition) in
  let cinfo = Declare.CInfo.make ~name ~typ:None () in
  let info = Declare.Info.make ~scope ~kind  ~udecl ~poly:false () in
  ignore (Declare.declare_definition ~info ~cinfo ~opaque:false ~body sigma)

(*
 * When you first start using a plugin, if you want to manipulate terms
 * in an interesting way, you need to move from the external representation
 * of terms to the internal representation of terms. This does that for you.
 *)
let internalize env trm sigma =
  Constrintern.interp_constr_evars env sigma trm

(* --- Equality --- *)
  
(*
 * This checks if there is any set of internal constraints in the state
 * such that trm1 and trm2 are definitionally equal in the current environment.
 *)
let equal env trm1 trm2 sigma =
  let opt = Reductionops.infer_conv env sigma trm1 trm2 in
  match opt with
  | Some sigma -> sigma, true
  | None -> sigma, false
