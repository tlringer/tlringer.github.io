							<h2>Getting Started</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						
						<p>Details coming soon!</p>
						
						<p>For the twentieth class, we are going to look at Sledgehammer in the wild! The paper we read on Tuesday was about Sledgehammer in practice. One of the coolest things about Sledgehammer is its extremely wide adoption in the Isabelle/HOL community. So we are going to look at some other people's proof developments, and how they use Sledgehammer or any of the automatic solvers it calls.</p>
						
						 <p>This exercise is going to be a bit more open-ended than what we've seen so far. Isabelle/HOL has an <a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/">archive</a> of proof developments; we will go through this archive to find developments that we like, and see how they use this automation. We'll also play around with modifying and understanding the development. We'll discuss in groups, then post on the board as usual. More <a href="#hack">below</a>.</p>
						
						<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
						
						<ol>
						<li>Install the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant following <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/installation.html">these instructions</a>.</li>
						<li>Download the Isabelle/HOL Archive of Formal Proofs <a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/download.html">here</a>.</li>
						<li>Browse the Archive of Formal Proofs <a href="https://www.isa-afp.org/">here</a>, and identify a project that looks interesting to you.</li>
						<li>Open the interesting project in Isabelle/HOL, and make sure the proofs go through.</li>
						</ol>
						
						 <p>If you have any trouble, please post your questions in <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/67">this thread</a>. Please also drop any installation tips you have in that thread.</p>
						 
						    <p>If installation fails, and the class forums are no help, do not panic; we will try to match you with someone in class for whom installation worked.</p>
						    <p>You can find the <a href="#hack">exercise</a> we will do together in class below.</p>

						<!-- TODO:
						  4. (During class) how often does it use sledgehammer/metis/meson/smt/etc? (Need to find exhaustive list, note that these were produced by sledgehammer)
						  5. Do you understand those proofs?
						  6. Try using sledgehammer there instead of metis/meson/etc, see if gives you the same proofs?
						  7. Does isar proofs work there? If so, tradeoffs?
						  7. Can you solve proofs that use sledgehammer/metis/meson/etc with more manual tactics? How hard?
						  8. Can you solve proofs that use more manual tactics with sledgehammer? How hard? (Refer to the tutorial)
						  9. Tradeoffs? Any sense of what it's good at versus bad at? etc. -->

						<p>During class, we will again divide up into groups. We will then step through the steps below:</p>
						
						<ol>
						<li>Coming soon!</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>You can do this on your own if you cannot make it to class, or enter a Zoom breakout if you're remote. Let me know if you can't attend, but would like me to find you a partner or make an exception.</p>
						
						<p>If you have extra time at the end, I recommend playing around with new theorems that you define, and how Sledgehammer handles them.</p>
						
						<p>As usual, the <b>only graded part</b> will be a discussion question: Coming soon!</p>
						    
						    <p>Please have your group post your answers in <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/68">this thread</a>, listing all group members in your response.</p>
