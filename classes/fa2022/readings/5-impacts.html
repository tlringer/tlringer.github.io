						    <p>This class, we will read
						    <b>Chapter 3</b> of 
						  <b>QED at Large: A Survey of Engineering of Formally Verified Software</b> [<a href="https://dependenttyp.es/pdf/QEDatLarge.pdf">PDF</a>] [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1561/2500000045">DOI</a>] by Talia Ringer, Karl Palmskog, Ilya Sergey, Milos Gligoric, and Zachary Tatlock.</p>
						  
						  <p>Chapter 3 is motivation, with a focus on <b>impacts</b>. It should give you a sense of some cool applications of proof assistants over the last several decades.<p>
						  
						  <!-- <p>You can find the video lightning lecture for the first class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzo4FTAmaOM">here</a>, and the corresponding slides with notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pNI5mVX2ORn_VffgVU1aUu0HGrJvbWfZwMo60Qe9qOU/edit">here</a>.</p>-->

							<h2>Reading Guide</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>I again recommend checking out <b><a href="https://taliasplse.wordpress.com/2019/09/14/proof-engineering-survey-paper-qed-a/">the reading guide</a></b> for this paper that I wrote a couple of years ago, if it helps you. Please also see <a href="https://proofengineering.org/qed_errata.html">the errata</a>.</p>
						    
						    <p>Chapter 3 is kind of dense---I wouldn't worry about remembering anything in particular about it. What I hope is that it gives you a sense of some of the cool applications of proof assistants that exist right now, and maybe also give you some ideas of other potential application domains. It's totally okay to <b>skim it</b>, and to <b>skip over paragraphs you find particularly dense</b>.</p>

							<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Please write a short paragraph as a comment in the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G943212C3/feed/4">class forum thread</a> about any one of the following discussion questions (you need to respond to <b>just one question</b> of your choice to get credit, though you're free to write more if interested):</p>
						    
						  <ol>
						  <li>What are some <b>example software systems you'd love to see formally verified</b> in a proof assistant, and what kinds of properties would you like to see verified about those systems? Are there any challenges that you anticipate in proving those properties about those systems?</li>
						  <li>Section 3.3 lists exactly one machine learning system that has been verified in a proof assistant. Based on what you know so far, <b>do you think there is much hope for verifying state-of-the-art machine learning systems</b> inside of a proof assistant? If so, why and how? And if not, what do you think it would take to be able to formally verify state-of-the-art machine learning systems?</li>
						  <li>Think a bit about the kinds of systems that have been formally verified in a proof assistant so far---and about the kinds of systems that haven't. Based on what you know so far, <b>what are some properties about a software system that make it particularly apt to formal verification</b> in a proof assistant? And do you think the barriers to reaching other kinds of software systems are fundamental, or do you think they are surmountable with lots of work?</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph <b>responding to someone else's comment</b> in the discussion forum.</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph about <b>any other single interesting thought, question, or idea that you had</b> in response to the reading.</li>
						  </ol>
