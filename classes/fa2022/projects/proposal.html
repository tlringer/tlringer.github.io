						<p>The goal of the final project proposal is to write 2-5 pages on some idea related to proof automation with your team. A successful proposal will give you the plan you need to get started on the proposed project; preliminary results are not needed.</p>
						
						<p>After the class, should your group wish to pursue the proposed project, I will help you find the resources you need to kick off the project. And of course, if not, no worries; hopefully you'll have gotten some useful experience writing project proposals.</p>

						<p>Your proposal should be <b>2-5 pages</b> not including citations. You should <b>send it to me by email</b> (tringer@illinois.edu) by December 15th, 2022 at 12:30 PM. It should have the following sections:</p>
						
						<ol>
						<li><b>Abstract</b>: a summary of the proposal.</li>
						<li><b>Introduction</b>: an overview of the problem and the proposed solution (at a high level), including a short summary of previous work in this space and how the proposed work will differ or improve upon it.</li>
						<li><b>Methods</b>: a summary of the technical approach that you will take to solve this problem, including any challenges that you anticipate arising, and how you might sovle this problems (it is OK if this is somewhat speculative).</li>
						<li><b>Evaluation</b>: how you expect to evaluate success.</li>
						<li><b>Timeline</b>: an approximate timeline for the project, including an explanation of any intermediate milestones.</li>
						</ol>

							<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						
						<p>The proposal is worth <b>10 points</b>. Of those 10 points, you will get <b>2 points for completing each of the 5 sections above</b>. You will get 1 point instead of 2 points for a particular section if that section is very obviously incomplete according to the descriptions above (for example, if you do not include any previous work in your introduction).</p>
						
						<p>Please do not stress too much about the quality of the idea. If you are interested in moving forward with an idea, I will happily give you feedback and help you refine it. But you should be fine as long as you write a complete proposal with each of the 5 sections described above.</p>
						
						<p>Good luck! And congrats on a wonderful semester! It was such a pleasure to teach all of you in the first class I've taught. Keep being awesome!</p>
