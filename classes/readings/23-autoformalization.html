One of Christian's papers and one of Stan's papers. But at a skim level, since there will hopefully be talks. This is to get familiar before the talk.
The discussion requirements will be framed around the talk accordingly, like think of one burning question to ask each of Christian and Stan (it's OK if the talk ends up answering it).
TBD explanation and more, and the papers themselves.
