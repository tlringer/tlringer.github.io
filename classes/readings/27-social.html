<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">Social Processes</a>. TBD this will take serious explanation of the context and my recommendations for how to approach it.
But I think it's really good to end on before future work because it can really get the gears turning about things that are harder than they should be,
and about what challenges of proof automation are fundamental.
This paper is what got me so obsessed that I did this thesis in my area.
It made me angry, honestly, and that translated into a mission to show that these challenges were not fundamental.
It's a weird call to read this last, but it's very deliberate.
