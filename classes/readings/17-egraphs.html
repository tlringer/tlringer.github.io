<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04391">Congruence Closure in Intensional Type Theory</a>.
This paper blew my mind, and you probably saw some teasers about this at the end of my last paper.
It's also a kind of dense read, but it's okay not to understand every part of it.
This paper means e-graphs even though they don't say it.
As a bonus, I'll link here to the two pager on e-graphs in Cubical Agda, and I'll also link to egg for curious readers.
TBD explanation and more.
