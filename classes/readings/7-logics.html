						    <p>For the seventh class, we will read <b>Interactive Proofs in a Higher-Order Concurrent Separation Logic</b> [<a href="https://iris-project.org/pdfs/2017-popl-proofmode-final.pdf">PDF</a>] [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009855">DOI</a>] by Robbert Krebbers, Amin Timany, and Lars Brikedal.</p>
						    
						    <p>This paper was a suggestion from my friend Tej Chajed. Tej recommended this paper because, in his words, "it's not search-style automation, but what it does do is implement a <b>high-level abstraction</b> (a more sophisticated logic) that happens to <b>look and feel similar to Coq's proof mode</b>. Using only the Iris Proof Mode, and maybe some lightweight extensions, we've been able to carry out pretty big proofs of program correctness. Some of it might be automated further but the [Iris Proof Mode] is really what makes things feasible because <b>each step is at such a high level of abstraction</b>."</p>
						    
						    <p>In other words, what we have is a <b>cool embedded logic</b> inside of Coq that empowers proof engineers to use <b>powerful automation</b> to reason about programs inside of the embedded logic in a way that </b>feels a lot like writing proofs outside of the embedding</b>.</p>
						  
						  <p>You can find my commentary about the seventh class <a href="https://dependenttyp.es/classes/commentary/7-logics.html">here</a>, and you can find a <a href="#guide">reading guide</a> and the <a href="#discussion">discussion questions</a> below.</p>
						  
						  <p>Please note that <b>this is due the morning before class</b>, so that we can discuss it in person. And <b>please install the <a href="https://dependenttyp.es/classes/artifacts/8-logics.html">artifact</a> before Thursday's class</b>.</p>

						    <p>For this paper, I think the cool things to focus on are the <b>design decisions</b> that make this kind of automation possible, what <b>interacting with it</b> is like, and the <b>problem it solves</b>.</p>
						
						    <p>The introduction, Section 2, and Section 3 are all very useful to read in detail. Section 2 talks about the <b>challenges of reasoning about programs</b> inside of a proof assistant using a few different common methodologies. Section 3 shows what <b>interacting with the automation</b> framework is like, so you can get a sense of the workflow for the implemented automation and the problem it solves.</p>
						    
						    <p>Section 4 talks about the <b>implementation</b>. This is an interesting read, but it's fine if you get a bit lost about the details. Hopefully we'll get a chance to dive into this when we look at the artifact on Thursday, and then we can get an even better sense of what's going.</p>
						    
						    <p>Sections 5 and 6 show <b>the framework in action</b> on an example and a large case study. These are good reads too, but it's very natural to get lost on the details of particular case studies. When we dive into the artifact, I hope these will be easier to follow, too.</p>
						    
						    <p>Section 7, the <b>evaluation</b>, is short enough that you may as well read the whole thing.</p>

						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Please write a short paragraph as a comment in the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/8">class forum thread</a> about any one of the following discussion questions (you need to respond to <b>just one question</b> of your choice to get credit, though you're free to write more if interested):</p>
						    
						  <ol>
						  <li>More questions coming soon!</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph <b>responding to someone else's comment</b> in the discussion forum.</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph about <b>any other single interesting thought, question, or idea that you had</b> in response to the reading.</li>
						  </ol>
						 
						  <p>You may want to look at other people's responses before class in order to shape the discussion. And again remember that you need to answer just one question to get credit, though you are free to answer more if interested.</p>
