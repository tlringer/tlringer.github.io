						    <p>For the second class, we will read
						    the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Ethics Code</a>. This is a code by which all computer scientists who submit to ACM conferences are bound. It does not give you easy answers, but it does give you <b>a useful framework</b> to think about the ethics of your research.</p>
						    
						   <p>It might seem kind of weird to read the ACM Ethics Code in a proof automation class. But I think <b>ethics are as fundamental to this work as type theory is</b>. What is any technology if we don't consider its impacts on humanity?</p>
						   
						   <p>I never really learned this stuff in graduate school, and I really wish I had. It was Timnit Gebru's dismissal from Google and its fallout that really got me thinking about the ethics of my own research. And now that I'm paying attention, I realize the ethical questions are <i>everywhere</i>. So I hope reading this and thinking about how it interacts with proof automation will be a useful exercise for all of you.</p>
						  
						  <p>You can find my commentary about the second class <a href="https://dependenttyp.es/classes/commentary/2-ethics.html">here</a>, and you can find a <a href="#guide">reading guide</a> and the <a href="#discussion">discussion questions</a> below.</p>
						  
						  <p>Please note that <b>because of POPL, this reading is not due until January 25th at 10:00 AM.</b> From next week forward, readings will be due the morning before the corresponding class.</p>

							<h2>Reading Guide</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Everyone is different here, but the way I got the most out of reading this code was by looking at each point, and <b>thinking about how it applied to a situation</b> that I had been in or heard about. After spending enough time doing this, I found that naturally when I encountered new situations in the wild, I'd think about particular points of the code that corresponded to it. I've found this useful not just for <b>making decisions</b> myself, but also for <b>raising concerns</b> to people in positions of power.</p>
						    
						    <p>If you cannot think of case studies relevant to your own research or situations you have read about elsewhere, the <a href="#discussion">discussion questions</a> below may help, and you may wish to read them before reading the code in order to frame your reading.</p>
						    
						    <p>Most of the code is, I think, about what one would expect. But there are some things I found genuinely surprising. I always hated all norms of confidentiality, but 1.7 convinced me to take it more seriously as a professional obligation. My personal favorite, though, is 2.3, which actually encourages you to <b>challenge and in some cases break unjust rules</b>. It's really refreshing to see that in a professional code. I also like 2.9, which makes a case for verification, and 3.6, which makes a case for automatic repair.</p>
						    
						    <p>But <b>not all verification work is inherently good</b>, even though we often like to imagine that it is. Like what if your proof automation is being used to verify a drone used by the US military? This can be a major strain with 3.1, and yet this is where a lot of verification funding comes from!</p>

						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Please write a short paragraph as a comment in the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/4">class forum thread</a> about any one of the following discussion questions (you need to respond to <b>just one question</b> of your choice to get credit, though you're free to write more if interested):</p>
						    
						  <ol>
						  <li>TBD</li>
						  <li>TBD</li>
						  <li>TBD</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph <b>responding to someone else's comment</b> in the discussion forum.</li>
						  <li>Write a paragraph about <b>any other single interesting thought, question, or idea that you had</b> in response to the reading.</li>
						  </ol>
						  
						  <p>Since the first week is asynchronous, we will not have this discussion in person. So, feel free to keep responding to each other if you find the conversation interesting---but no pressure. You'll get credit as long as you write about just one of the above.</p>
