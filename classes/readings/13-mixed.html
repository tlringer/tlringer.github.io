						    <p>For the thirteenth class, we will read
						    <b>Generating Good Generators for Inductive Relations</b> [<a href="https://lemonidas.github.io/pdf/GeneratingGoodGenerators.pdf">PDF</a>] by Leonidas Lampropoulos, Zoe Paraskevopoulou, and Benjamin C. Pierce.</p>
		    
						    <p>This is a really cool paper that's all about how to use <b>property-based testing</b>---like QuickCheck of Haskell fame---to make sure the theorems you state are actually correct. Otherwise, you might waste time trying to prove a false theorem!</p>
						    
						    <p>We are super lucky to have the first author Leo available remotely to give a quick talk on QuickChick. So reading this paper is mostly a way to <b>prepare for that talk</b>, so it's easier to follow and ask informed questions. We will have time for an open discussion after the talk and Q&A.</p>
	  
						  <p>You can find a <a href="#guide">reading guide</a> and the <a href="#discussion">discussion questions</a> below.</p>
						  
						  <p>Please note that <b>this is due the morning before class</b>, so that we can discuss it in person. And <b>please install the <a href="https://dependenttyp.es/classes/artifacts/14-mixed.html">artifact</a> before Thursday's class</b>.</p>

						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Since this is to prepare for a talk, I recommend focusing just on understanding enough to follow the talk and asked informed questions to the speaker. It's also fine and normal not to understand absolutely everything before the talk. Perhaps focus on understanding something you find interesting, or on thinking of questions to ask the speaker.</p>

							<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="align-left">
						    <p>Since we have a guest speaker, this week will be a bit different. Please write a short paragraph as a comment in the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GC575C0C8/feed/11">class forum thread</a> with a <b>single question or comment you would relay to the speaker</b> (the first author of this paper) based on the reading. It's okay if the speaker ends up answering the question or addressing the comment in the talk---sometimes that's actually a good sign!</p>
						    
						   <p>Here are some example things you may wish to include in such a question or comment:</p>
						    
						  <ol>
						  <li><b>Confusions</b> about how things work, including technical details.</li>
						  <li><b>Ideas</b> for future work---and questions about whether the speaker has thought about implementing them.</li>
						  <li><b>Concerns</b> for how things may go wrong, and questions about how the speaker handles those situations.</li>
						  <li><b>Curiosities</b> about things you found particularly impressive or interesting, and would like to hear a lot more about.</li>
						  </ol>
						 
						  <p>I strongly encourage you to ask questions after the talk, though it's fine if they are not the questions you originally write in the discussion board. You may want to look at other people's responses before class in order to shape the discussion. And again remember that you need to write just one paragraph to get credit, though you are free to write more if interested.</p>
